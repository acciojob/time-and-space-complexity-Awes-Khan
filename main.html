	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm very efficiently.</p>
	<p>The total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution is termed as Space Complexity. It may have various type including O(n) </p>
	<b>Space Complexity is very crusial to write efficient programs.</b>
